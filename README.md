# youtube-playlist-to-QR-codes


This program retrieves all items from a YouTube playlist, generates a QR code for each item that contains the URL of the video, and saves the QR codes to PNG files in a directory named after the playlist. It uses the smallest possible QR code version that can encode the URL based on its length. Please replace "YOUR API KEY" and "insert playlist ID here" with your own API key and playlist ID, respectively.

Please note that this code requires the qrcode and googleapiclient Python libraries.
You can install these libraries with pip:

`pip install qrcode google-api-python-client`

If you're not familiar with pip, it's a package installer for Python. You can use it to install libraries that add functionality to your Python programs. You'll need to run this command in your system's command line interface. If you're on Windows, you can use Command Prompt. If you're on macOS or Linux, you can use Terminal.

Also, remember to replace "YOUR API KEY" and "insert playlist ID here" with your actual YouTube Data API v3 key and the ID of the playlist you want to work with. You can obtain an API key by creating a project in the Google Cloud Console. The playlist ID can be found in the URL of the playlist on YouTube.

Lastly, this script uses the os module to create directories, which may not work as expected if you're running the script on a system that doesn't allow Python scripts to create directories (some online Python execution environments, for example). In such cases, you might need to modify the script to work around this limitation, or run the script on a different system.
