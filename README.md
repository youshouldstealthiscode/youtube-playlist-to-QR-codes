# youtube-playlist-to-QR-codes


This program retrieves all items from a YouTube playlist, generates a QR code for each item that contains the URL of the video, and saves the QR codes to PNG files in a directory named after the playlist. It uses the smallest possible QR code version that can encode the URL based on its length. Please replace "YOUR API KEY" and "insert playlist ID here" with your own API key and playlist ID, respectively.

Please note that this code requires the qrcode and googleapiclient Python libraries.
You can install these libraries with pip:

`pip install qrcode google-api-python-client`

If you're not familiar with pip, it's a package installer for Python. You can use it to install libraries that add functionality to your Python programs. You'll need to run this command in your system's command line interface. If you're on Windows, you can use Command Prompt. If you're on macOS or Linux, you can use Terminal.

Also, remember to replace "YOUR API KEY" and "insert playlist ID here" with your actual YouTube Data API v3 key and the ID of the playlist you want to work with. You can obtain an API key by creating a project in the Google Cloud Console. The playlist ID can be found in the URL of the playlist on YouTube.

Lastly, this script uses the os module to create directories, which may not work as expected if you're running the script on a system that doesn't allow Python scripts to create directories (some online Python execution environments, for example). In such cases, you might need to modify the script to work around this limitation, or run the script on a different system.


------------------------STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THIS PROGRAM IN macOS TERMINAL------------------------


1. **Install Python:** If you haven't already installed Python on your machine, you can download it from the official website here: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Download the latest version and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install Pip:** Pip is a package installer for Python, and it is usually installed with Python. You can check if pip is installed by typing `pip --version` in your terminal. If it is not installed, you can download and install it from here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/.

3. **Install the necessary libraries:** You need two Python libraries to run this code: `qrcode` and `google-api-python-client`. You can install them by running the following commands in your terminal:
   
   `pip install qrcode && pip install google-api-python-client`

4. **Save the code:** Open a text editor (like TextEdit), paste the Python code into it, and save the file with a .py extension (for example, `generate_qr_codes.py`).

5. **Replace placeholders in the code:** You need to replace `"YOUR API KEY"` and `"insert playlist ID here"` in the code with your actual YouTube Data API v3 key and the ID of the playlist you want to work with.

   - To get the API key, you need to create a project in the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable the YouTube Data API v3, and create credentials for the API key.

   - The playlist ID can be found in the URL of the playlist on YouTube. For example, in `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3tRBEVW0hiDAf0LeFLFH8S83JWBjvtqE`, the playlist ID is `PL3tRBEVW0hiDAf0LeFLFH8S83JWBjvtqE`.

6. **Run the code:** Open Terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file using the `cd` command (for example, `cd /Users/yourusername/Documents/`), and then type `python generate_qr_codes.py` to run the code.

Please note that Python and pip must be in your system's PATH for these commands to work. If you installed Python from the official website and accepted the default settings, they should already be in your PATH.
